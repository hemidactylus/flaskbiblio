TODO

* nice-looking pages

* searches, pagination and so on

* warn against deleting authors when they appear in n>0 books (list no. of books per author in the au-list page)

* when inserting a new author (book also?) warn if the vectorisation detects a cosine-similar item already on DB.
    This requires that since the start items have vectors stored on DB (for speed)

* check against non-ascii chars everywhere
    - upon db insertion

* deploy within a lighty or apache or nginx environment (fastCGI? gunicorn? flup? .htaccess?)
