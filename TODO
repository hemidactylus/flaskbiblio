TODO

* nice-looking pages

* searches, pagination and so on

* warn against deleting authors when they appear in n>0 books (list no. of books per author in the au-list page)

* when inserting a new author (book also?) warn if the vectorisation detects a cosine-similar item already on DB.
    This requires that since the start items have vectors stored on DB (for speed)
    Or that every time they are re-calculated (bah)

* deploy within a lighty or apache or nginx environment (fastCGI? gunicorn? flup? .htaccess?)

* Add+replace author must become a single call to reuse code.
    And must accept an Author instance to then automatize arguments copying in db-calls
