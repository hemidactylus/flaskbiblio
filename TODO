TODO

* nice-looking pages

* searches, pagination and so on

* when inserting a new author (book also?) warn if the vectorisation detects a cosine-similar item already on DB.
    Done. But at the moment:
        - it is done for authors
        - it is evaluated on the fly for all authors
        - the desired check-box in the edit form is handled in a very cumbersone way in the endpoint code
        * Should rewrite and largely streamline the whole edit/insert endpoint handling!

* deploy within a lighty or apache or nginx environment (fastCGI? gunicorn? flup? .htaccess?)

* in the two addreplace calls, when updating: the list of attributes must be cleverly handled instead of a lot of
    explicit member copies that are now being done.

* user settings (profile pic, options, change password ...)

* homepage with stats

* Users with "read only" (i.e. guest) privileges - they can browse anything but no changes whatsoever
    Done, with both hiding edit links in the interface and serious checks in the code.
    Among the latter, missing:
        check if user.canedit in add book, delete book, edit book (everywhere!)
        Also in add new book and recheck in add new author.
