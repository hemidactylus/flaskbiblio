* nice-looking pages

* searches, pagination and so on

* when inserting a new author (book also?) warn if the vectorisation detects a cosine-similar item already on DB.
    This requires that since the start items have vectors stored on DB (for speed)
    Or that every time they are re-calculated (bah) - at the moment it's like that!
    And TO DO at the moment it's just a flashing warning and lets you proceed nevertheless (line ~200)

* Use flash+operational checkbox for edit/insert--mode need for confirmation
    (as opposed to delete-mode use of confirm dialog)

* deploy within a lighty or apache or nginx environment (fastCGI? gunicorn? flup? .htaccess?)

* in the two addreplace calls, when updating: the list of attributes must be cleverly handled instead of a lot of
    explicit member copies that are now being done.

* user settings (profile pic, options, change password ...)

* homepage with stats

* Users with "read only" (i.e. guest) privileges - they can browse anything but no changes whatsoever
