* nice-looking pages
    STATUS:
        navbar DONE
        buttons DONE
        a common style with heading + contents for all pages
        Buttons for pagination/search control, using the 12-ticks bstrap grid and fixed positions

* searches, pagination and so on
    A (not-so-well-scaling, perhaps cumbersome) method to handle pagination is up and running.

* when inserting a new author or book warn if the vectorisation detects a cosine-similar item already on DB.
    Done. But at the moment:
        - it is evaluated on the fly for all authors/books
        - the desired check-box in the edit form is handled in a very cumbersone way in the endpoint code
        * Should rewrite and largely streamline the whole edit/insert endpoint handling!
        * Should outsource the similar-* issue to a separate module
        * Should uniformize the edits and form-to-object, reqargs-to-form mechanics.

        * Perhaps work on 2-gram of letters, might be funnier?

* deploy within a lighty or apache or nginx environment (fastCGI? gunicorn? flup? .htaccess?)

* in the two addreplace calls, when updating: the list of attributes must be cleverly handled instead of a lot of
    explicit member copies that are now being done.

* A separate setting for 'check for similar names'
    its (futurely, a slider) settings

* when 'cancel' on confirm-form, I should get back to the query if any and not to the full results

* Some advanced stats in a dedicated subpage of 'index'
    E.g. book breakdown per genre
    E.g. percentage and number of books that are out

* CLEANUPS
    - all urls in template html's must be built with url_for
    - remember_me checkbox, what to do with that?
        restore remember me on visible login only when know how to treat it
