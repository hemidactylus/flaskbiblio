TODO

* nice-looking pages

* searches, pagination and so on

* warn against deleting authors when they appear in n>0 books (list no. of books per author in the au-list page)
    transactions lock the updates until the book-per-author counters are adjusted
    WORKING ON THIS.

* when inserting a new author (book also?) warn if the vectorisation detects a cosine-similar item already on DB.
    This requires that since the start items have vectors stored on DB (for speed)
    Or that every time they are re-calculated (bah)

* deploy within a lighty or apache or nginx environment (fastCGI? gunicorn? flup? .htaccess?)

* in the two addreplace calls, when updating the list of attributes must be cleverly handled instead of a lot of
    explicit member copies that are now being done.

* validate e.g. author list transactionally, right when inserting a book and its book-counters in authors,
    and so on

* user settings (profile pic, options, change password ...)

* homepage with stats
